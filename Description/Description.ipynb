    "the task is to get a general idea about content-based video retrieval. In the previous assignment, the audio information was used for retrieval purposes. In this task you will use the visual information of a video. You will get insights on visual feature extraction, applying similarity measures, shot cut detection, and how to perform meaningful classification for retrieval purposes. <br>\n",

    "An additional bonus task is provided to get some extra points. In the bonus task you will combine the extracted audio and video features to build a multimodal retrieval system. </p>\n",

Make sure that you run the code cells from the main notebooks (Task1.ipynb, Task2.ipynb etc.) that imports your Implementation to present your results. The output of these code cells should be the basis for the discussions in the assessment meetings, so think about how you want to present your results.</li>  \n",
