    "<li>Within each Task folder, you will find a Task Notebook (i.e. <strong>Task1.ipynb</strong>) that contains detailed descriptions about what you have to do, as well as code snippets that should support you in testing your own implementation.</li>\n",
    "<li>For each Task, provide your own implementation in the corresponding task folder in a Notebook called <strong>Implementation.ipynb</strong></li>\n",
    "<li><strong>Implementation.ipynb</strong> should implement all functions needed for the example calls in the corresponding Task description.</li>\n",
    "<li>Your Implementation notebook will be imported into the Task description (using the <strong>run</strong> command) and the example calls should result in correct output.</li>\n",
    "<li>You will find two example Tasks in Assignment 0 that should illustrate this functionality.</li>\n",
    "<li>In the end, your solution should be well presented inside the Task notebook. Everything that can be seen there serves as a  basis for the assessment meeting, so think about how you want to present your solution!</li>\n",
